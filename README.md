# STAT 717 - SAS Projects (Spring 2022)
Overview
This repository contains SAS statistical analysis projects completed for STAT 717 (Spring 2022). These projects focus on categorical data analysis, hypothesis testing, and ordinal association measures using PROC FREQ, PROC MEANS, and PROC GENMOD in SAS.

The projects demonstrate various statistical techniques, including:

Chi-Square tests for independence.
Odds ratio and relative risk analysis.
Risk difference estimation.
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) tests for ordinal data.
Mid-rank scoring for ordered categorical variables.
Pairwise comparisons using categorical data analysis.
Each dataset is structured to analyze real-world statistical problems, from smoking and health risks to demographic comparisons and ordinal scoring methods.

Projects
1. Cigarette Consumption & Disease Risk (Project 2 - Cancer Study)
Objective: Analyze the relationship between cigarette consumption and disease (cancer vs. control group).

Methods Used:
PROC FREQ: Odds ratio, relative risk, and chi-square tests.
Risk Difference Analysis: Assessing differences in smoking-related disease probabilities.
Data Structuring: Two formats (wide and long) were used for analysis.
Key Findings:
Higher smoking levels correlate with increased odds of cancer.
Statistical significance was tested using chi-square and risk difference measures.
2. Gender Distribution & Statistical Independence (Project 3 - Country & Gender Study)
Objective: Investigate gender distribution across different countries (USA vs. Brazil).

Methods Used:
PROC FREQ: Chi-square tests and CMH for measuring associations.
Risk Difference Analysis: Comparing male vs. female distributions in each country.
Expected Counts & Residual Analysis: Identifying deviations from expected gender proportions.
Key Findings:
Significant differences in gender distribution were found across countries.
Residual analysis highlighted which groups contributed to the variation.
3. Midterm Analysis: Age, Status, and Ordinal Scores (Projects 4-7 - Ordinal Association Tests)
Objective: Study the relationship between age groups, health status, and ordinal scoring methods.

Methods Used:
Chi-Square Test for Independence: Examining whether age affects health status.
CMH Tests with Scoring Systems: Using different scoring schemes to measure ordinal relationships.
Mean Score Computation: Comparing average scores across different age groups.
Pairwise Comparisons: Conducting statistical tests between selected age groups.
Key Findings:
Ordered categories showed clear statistical trends across different scoring schemes.
Pairwise comparisons provided insights into differences between age groups.
CMH tests confirmed ordinal relationships in categorical data.
