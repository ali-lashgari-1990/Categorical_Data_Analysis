# Categorical_Data_Analysis

SAS Statistical Analysis (STAT 717)
Spring 2022

Project Overview:

This project demonstrates statistical analysis using SAS PROC FREQ to analyze categorical data. The dataset consists of gender-wise counts of individuals from two countries (USA and Brazil), and the analysis includes:

Chi-Square Test for Independence

Risk Difference Analysis

Residual Analysis


Objectives:

Perform contingency table analysis using PROC FREQ.

Compute risk differences with confidence intervals.

Conduct Chi-Square and CMH tests for association.

Analyze Pearson and Standardized residuals.

Dataset Description:

The dataset consists of gender counts for two countries.

Methods Used:

PROC FREQ: Cross-tabulations, Chi-Square Test, Risk Difference Analysis.

PROC GENMOD (commented out): Adjusted residuals computation using Poisson regression.



Results:

The Chi-Square test determines if gender distribution is significantly different between the USA and Brazil.

Pearson Residuals & Standardized Residuals identify where deviations occur.

Risk Difference Analysis helps in assessing categorical risks.

Key Takeaways:

Chi-Square tests are useful for categorical independence testing.

Residual analysis provides deeper insight into table discrepancies.

Risk difference metrics aid in understanding groupwise variations.
